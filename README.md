# csv-generator
Creates a CSV file with the header and fake data you specify.

Zero effort has been put into making this user friendly. :)

- Everytime you run the app, your existing CSV file will be overwritten
- Modify the code to change the header or the fake data to be generated (see csv_generator.rb comments for details)
